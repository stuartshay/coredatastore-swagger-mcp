# CoreDataStore Swagger MCP Server - Active Context

## Current Focus
We've identified accessibility issues with the remote MCP server at `mcp.coredatastore.com`. Currently, the server is returning 403 Forbidden errors. As a result, we've switched to running the MCP server locally for development and testing purposes.

## Recent Changes
1. **Local MCP Server Setup**: Due to 403 Forbidden errors from the remote server at `mcp.coredatastore.com`, we've set up the MCP server to run locally. The local server successfully fetches the Swagger specification and creates MCP tools.

2. **Documentation Update**: Updated README.md with the production URL and instructions for using the deployed server.

3. **VSCode Configuration Setup**: Added complete VSCode configuration to enhance development experience.
   - Created `.vscode/settings.json` with linting, formatting, and editor preferences
   - Added `.vscode/launch.json` with debug configurations for Node.js development
   - Created `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions for this project
   - Added ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.json`) aligned with project's coding standards
   - Added Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc`) for consistent code formatting
   - Added EditorConfig (`.editorconfig`) for editor-agnostic style definitions
   - Added JavaScript configuration (`jsconfig.json`) for better IntelliSense

2. **Code Quality Tooling Enhancements**:
   - Using ESLint version 8.57.0 (compatible with .eslintrc.json configuration)
   - Added Prettier version 3.2.5 for code formatting
   - Added Husky and lint-staged for Git hooks
   - Created script for setting up pre-commit hooks (`scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`)
   - Created script for code formatting and linting (`scripts/format-code.sh`)
   - Added npm scripts for linting and formatting tasks
   - Fixed dependency loop issue in Git hooks and formatting scripts
   - Separated Git hooks setup from npm prepare lifecycle to prevent loops

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow Update**: We've modified the deployment workflow to use Google Artifact Registry consistently instead of mixing Container Registry and Artifact Registry references.
   - Changed image name format from `gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/...` to `us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/coredatastore/...`
   - Added a step to create the Artifact Registry repository if it doesn't exist
   - Updated step names to reflect the correct registry type
   - Fixed YAML syntax issues in the workflow file

3. **Service Account Authentication**: Verified the service account has the necessary permissions to interact with Artifact Registry and Cloud Run.

## Active Issues
1. **Remote MCP Server Accessibility**: The remote MCP server at `mcp.coredatastore.com` is returning 403 Forbidden errors for both the `/health` and `/mcp` endpoints. This suggests that either:
   - The server is not publicly accessible anymore
   - There are authentication requirements that we need to meet
   - The server configuration has changed

2. **Local Development Setup**: Using the local MCP server for development, which requires the server to be running whenever we want to use the MCP tools.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Core Functionality Implementations**:
   - Implemented input validation using Ajv JSON Schema validation
   - Added standardized error handling and response formatting
   - Implemented structured logging system with different log levels
   - Added API response caching with time-based expiration
   - Implemented support for paginated API responses
   - Created utility modules for all of the above

## Next Steps
1. **Investigate Remote Server Issues**: Determine why the remote MCP server at `mcp.coredatastore.com` is returning 403 Forbidden errors. Possible actions include:
   - Check with the server administrators about access permissions
   - Investigate if there are new authentication requirements
   - Verify if the server endpoints have changed

2. **Enhance Local Development Experience**: Consider improving the local development setup to make it more seamless:
   - Add scripts to easily start/stop the local MCP server
   - Automate the MCP configuration process

3. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect the current state of the MCP server access.

4. **Implement Automated Testing**: Now that we have the core functionality in place, we should add:
   - Unit tests for utility classes
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - End-to-end tests for MCP tool execution

5. **Review Service Account Permissions**: If deployment issues persist, we should review the service account permissions to ensure it has:
   - `roles/artifactregistry.writer` for pushing images
   - `roles/run.admin` for deploying to Cloud Run
   - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` for acting as the service account

6. **Additional Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add more API endpoints to the Express proxy
   - Implement more refined error handling for specific API errors
   - Add monitoring and analytics for tool usage

## Current Decisions
1. **Local MCP Server**: We've decided to use a locally running MCP server for development and testing purposes, due to issues accessing the remote server.

2. **MCP Client Configuration**: Updated the MCP client configuration to use the local server rather than the remote one:
   ```json
   "coredatastore-swagger-mcp": {
     "autoApprove": [],
     "disabled": false,
     "timeout": 60,
     "command": "node",
     "args": ["/home/vagrant/git/coredatastore-swagger-mcp/src/index.js"],
     "transportType": "stdio"
   }
   ```

3. **Google Artifact Registry**: We're still using Google Artifact Registry for Docker images when deploying, as it's Google's recommended and more feature-rich container registry service.

4. **Region Selection**: We're continuing to use `us-east4` for both Artifact Registry and Cloud Run services to minimize latency and data transfer costs.

## Open Questions
1. Why is the remote MCP server at `mcp.coredatastore.com` returning 403 Forbidden errors? Has the access control changed?
2. Should we implement authentication for our local MCP server to match the potential security requirements of the remote server?
3. Should we implement versioning for the Docker images beyond the GitHub run number?
4. Do we need to implement any additional authentication mechanisms for the API requests?
5. Would it be beneficial to add resource-based access controls for the deployed service?
