# CoreDataStore Swagger MCP Server - Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ MCP Server implementation with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- ✅ Dynamic tool generation from Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- ✅ Tool listing capability for MCP clients
- ✅ Tool execution with parameter processing
- ✅ Express server for local API proxying
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Docker containerization

### CI/CD Pipeline

- ✅ Docker image building with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Image uploading to artifact registry
- ✅ Deployment to Google Cloud Run
- ✅ Fixed artifact registry configuration and authentication

### Documentation
- ✅ README with setup and usage instructions
- ✅ Environment variable documentation
- ✅ Deployment documentation
- ✅ License information
- ✅ Memory Bank documentation structure

### Development Environment
- ✅ VSCode settings configuration
- ✅ ESLint configuration
- ✅ Prettier configuration
- ✅ Recommended extensions list
- ✅ Debug configurations

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality
- ❌ Input validation for tool parameters
- ❌ Error response standardization
- ❌ Improved logging system
- ❌ API response caching
- ❌ Support for paginated API responses

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ❌ Automated testing in GitHub Actions
- ❌ Versioning strategy for releases
- ❌ Multi-environment deployment (staging, production)
- ❌ Environment-specific configuration

### Documentation
- ❌ API endpoint documentation
- ❌ Generated tool documentation
- ❌ Contributing guidelines
- ❌ Changelog

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP Server | ✅ Operational | Basic functionality implemented |
| Tool Generation | ✅ Operational | All Swagger endpoints converted to tools |
| Express Server | ✅ Operational | Health check and basic proxy working |
| Docker Support | ✅ Complete | Working Dockerfile and build process |
| GitHub Actions | 🔄 In Progress | Fixed authentication issue, awaiting verification |
| Cloud Run Deployment | 🔄 In Progress | Pending successful workflow execution |
| Testing | ❌ Not Started | No automated tests implemented yet |
| Documentation | 🔄 In Progress | Basic documentation available, needs expansion |

## Known Issues

1. **GitHub Actions Deployment**:
   - ~~Authentication error with Google Container Registry~~ (FIXED)
   - Solution: Updated workflow to use Artifact Registry consistently

2. **Swagger Processing**:
   - Some complex schema types may not be properly converted to tool input schemas
   - Limited support for nested objects in parameters

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling implemented, but not comprehensive
   - API errors could be better formatted for MCP clients

4. **Performance**:
   - No caching mechanism for frequent API requests
   - Tool generation at startup could be optimized
