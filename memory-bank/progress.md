- ✅ Error response standardization
- ✅ Improved logging system
- ✅ API response caching
- ✅ Support for paginated API responses

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Automated testing in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Versioning strategy for releases
- ❌ Multi-environment deployment (staging, production) - Reverted, to be revisited later
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration

### Documentation
- ❌ API endpoint documentation

- ❌ Contributing guidelines
- ❌ Changelog

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP Server | ✅ Operational | Basic functionality implemented |
| Tool Generation | ✅ Operational | All Swagger endpoints converted to tools |
| Express Server | ✅ Operational | Health check and basic proxy working |
| Docker Support | ✅ Complete | Working Dockerfile and build process |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Complete | Authentication issue fixed, deployment successful |
| Cloud Run Deployment | ✅ Operational | Successfully deployed and accessible at mcp.coredatastore.com |
| Testing | 🔄 In Progress | Unit tests for utility classes complete, need integration and E2E tests |
| Documentation | 🔄 In Progress | Updated with production URL, needs further expansion |

## Known Issues

1. ~~**Remote MCP Server Accessibility**~~: (RESOLVED)
   - ~~The deployed server at mcp.coredatastore.com returns 403 Forbidden errors~~
   - ~~Both /health and /mcp endpoints are inaccessible~~
   - The accessibility issues with the remote MCP server have been resolved.

2. **GitHub Actions Deployment**:
   - ~~Authentication error with Google Container Registry~~ (FIXED)
   - Solution: Updated workflow to use Artifact Registry consistently

2. **Swagger Processing**:
   - Some complex schema types may not be properly converted to tool input schemas
   - Limited support for nested objects in parameters

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling implemented, but not comprehensive
   - API errors could be better formatted for MCP clients

4. **Performance**:
   - No caching mechanism for frequent API requests
   - Tool generation at startup could be optimized
