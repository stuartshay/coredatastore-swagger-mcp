## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP Server | ‚úÖ Operational | Basic functionality implemented |
| Tool Generation | ‚úÖ Operational | All Swagger endpoints converted to tools |
| Express Server | ‚úÖ Operational | Health check and basic proxy working |
| Docker Support | ‚úÖ Complete | Working Dockerfile and build process |
| GitHub Actions | ‚úÖ Complete | Authentication issue fixed, deployment successful |
| Cloud Run Deployment | ‚úÖ Operational | Successfully deployed and accessible at mcp.coredatastore.com |
| Testing | üîÑ In Progress | Unit tests for utility classes complete, need integration and E2E tests |
| Documentation | üîÑ In Progress | Updated with production URL, needs further expansion |

## Known Issues

1. ~~**Remote MCP Server Accessibility**~~: (RESOLVED)
   - ~~The deployed server at mcp.coredatastore.com returns 403 Forbidden errors~~
   - ~~Both /health and /mcp endpoints are inaccessible~~
   - The accessibility issues with the remote MCP server have been resolved.

2. **GitHub Actions Deployment**:
   - ~~Authentication error with Google Container Registry~~ (FIXED)
   - Solution: Updated workflow to use Artifact Registry consistently

2. **Swagger Processing**:
   - Some complex schema types may not be properly converted to tool input schemas
   - Limited support for nested objects in parameters

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling implemented, but not comprehensive
   - API errors could be better formatted for MCP clients

4. **Performance**:
   - No caching mechanism for frequent API requests
   - Tool generation at startup could be optimized
