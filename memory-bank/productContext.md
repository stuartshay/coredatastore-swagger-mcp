# CoreDataStore Swagger MCP Server - Product Context

## Problem Space
AI assistants need a standardized way to access external data sources and APIs. Without this standardization, each integration requires custom development and lacks a consistent interface. The CoreDataStore API contains valuable NYC landmarks data, but direct integration with AI systems is challenging.

## Solution
The CoreDataStore Swagger MCP server addresses these challenges by:
1. Implementing the Model Context Protocol standard
2. Automatically converting a Swagger/OpenAPI specification into MCP tools
3. Providing a bridge between AI assistants and the CoreDataStore API
4. Enabling dynamic discovery and use of API capabilities

## Target Users
- AI assistant developers who want to integrate with CoreDataStore API
- Developers building applications that utilize NYC landmarks data
- Researchers and enthusiasts interested in historical NYC landmarks

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Integration**: AI assistants should be able to connect to the MCP server with minimal configuration
- **Discoverability**: All API capabilities should be automatically exposed as MCP tools
- **Reliability**: Stable and consistent responses from the API
- **Performance**: Low-latency responses for interactive AI usage
- **Flexibility**: Support for various query patterns and data retrieval methods

## Use Cases
1. **Data Retrieval**: AI assistants fetch landmark information based on user queries
2. **Exploration**: Discovering landmarks in specific areas or with certain characteristics
3. **Research**: Accessing detailed historical information about NYC landmarks
4. **Location-Based Services**: Finding landmarks near a specific location
5. **Visualization Support**: Retrieving data to generate visualizations of landmark locations and information

## Value Proposition
- Eliminates the need for custom integration between AI systems and the CoreDataStore API
- Leverages the standardized MCP for consistent interaction patterns
- Automatically adapts to changes in the API through dynamic tool generation
- Provides a single, reliable access point for NYC landmarks data
- Reduces development time for AI assistant capabilities related to NYC landmarks

## Success Indicators
- Number of successfully generated MCP tools from the API specification
- Reliability and uptime of the MCP server
- Response time and performance metrics
- Adoption by AI assistant developers
- User satisfaction with the data access capabilities
