# CoreDataStore Swagger MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview
CoreDataStore Swagger MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that dynamically generates tools from the CoreDataStore API's Swagger/OpenAPI specification. This enables AI assistants to interact with NYC landmarks data through a standardized protocol.

## Core Objectives
1. Create a bridge between AI assistants and the CoreDataStore API through MCP
2. Dynamically generate MCP tools from the API's Swagger specification
3. Provide a proxy service for API requests
4. Enable seamless access to NYC landmarks data
5. Deploy to Google Cloud Run for production availability

## Key Requirements
- Dynamic tool generation based on Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- MCP-compliant server implementation
- Express server for local API queries and proxy functionality
- Containerization with Docker
- Automated deployment to Google Cloud Run
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Successfully generated MCP tools from all relevant API endpoints
- Proper handling of API requests and responses
- Seamless integration with AI assistants through MCP
- Reliable deployment pipeline to Google Cloud Run
- Comprehensive documentation for users

## Timeline and Milestones
- Initial server implementation
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- MCP tool generation
- Express server and proxy implementation
- Docker containerization
- Google Cloud Run deployment setup
- Testing and validation
- Documentation and release
